 OVERVIEW:

 This class was written to hold non-DISM-specific data structures that are useful to a DISM API user, but do not neatly fit
 into the managed, wrapped classes.

 USAGE AND NOTES:

 The standard usage of the DismApi begins with "DismApi.Initialize()" and ends with "DismApi.Shutdown()", wrapping the same standard functionality
 of the Microsoft DISM C library. However, this functionality is limited to the (local) version of dismapi.dll, located (in most cases) in \System32.

 DISM has not always been built-in to Windows, however, and is also provided (as part of a stand-alone tool package) known as "Windows Assessment and Installation Kit"
 (or "WAIK", Windows 7 era), and now as "Windows Assessment and Deployment Kit" (or "WADK", Windows 8.0 - now.)

 Users install WADK (and/or WAIK) tools to include standard Windows PE images, DISM tools, and other Windows management tooling.

 In servicing images (online or .WIM), the built-in version of DISM (if even available) may not be able to service different version(s) of images.
 For example, as of the Windows 10 Fall Creator's Update (DISM 10.0.16299.15), the built-in version of DISM cannot open a session against a Windows PE 4.0 image (based on Windows 8.0.)
 I presume the same is true of Windows PE 5.0 (based on Windows 8.1.) Thus, in order to service different versions of images, the tooling of DISM from WADK/WAIK is necessary.
 (Upon investigation, the DISM libraries included in WADK/WAIK include more libraries than what's included in Windows alone, including downleveling libraries, which are presumably for handling
 older/other versions/architectures, etc.)

 WITH RESPECT TO DISM TOOLING:

 1.  Microsoft was calling the toolset "Windows Assessment and Installation Kit" as of Windows 7, but now calls it the "Windows Assessment and Deployment Kit" (starting with 8.0 and continuing on.)

 2.  WAIK (Windows 7) can be installed to provide Windows PE 3.0 (and DISM servicing), OR WAIK Service Pack 1 can be installed for Windows PE 3.1 (and DISM servicing), but both cannot be
     installed at the same time.

 3.  WADK (Windows 8.0) can be installed to provide support for Windows PE 4.0 (and DISM servicing), OR WADK (Windows 8.1) can be installed for Windows PE 5.0 (and DISM servicing), but both
     cannot be installed at the same time.

 4.  Only one version of WADK (Windows 10.x) can be installed to provide support for Windows PE 10 (and DISM servicing) at the same time.

 5.  Thus, a user could potentially have WAIK 3.0 or 3.1 installed, WADK 4.0 or 5.0 installed, and WADK 10 installed, all at the same time. In doing so, they could create and service Windows PE images
     from Windows 7/7 SP1, 8/8.1, and 10.

 6.  Regardless of what OS you (or a user) has, it is recommended to install the latest version of the WADK (10.x as of this writing), as the latest tooling should contain support for and be able to service older images.
     Therefore, WADK 10.x (and it's DISM libraries) can service images of Windows 7, 8, 8.1, 10.x.

 LOADING A SPECIFIC DISM LIBRARY:

 1.  Use the Properties ("WADK10DISMAPIPath") to determine if said version of WADK/WAIK is installed, and if so, where the DISM API libraries are installed.
     "GetLatestDismGeneration()" will search all paths and provide the latest installed version, if available, as an enumeration.

 2.  Call "LoadDismGenerationLibrary()" BEFORE you call DismApi.Initialize(). This works because we use the native "LoadLibrary()" method to load the specified DISM generational library into the process space,
     and when you call "DismApi.Initialize()", the Marshal (via DllImport()) looks in process space first for a loaded module. Upon finding a module that matches the requested one's name, it then loads it
     (and any other associated libraries) as needed.

 3.  After calling "DismApi.Shutdown()", call "UnloadDismGenerationLibrary()" to remove the loaded DISM library from the process space.

 4.  In this fashion, one could load DISM from WADK 10, unload it, load DISM from WAIK, unload it, load DISM from the System, etc.

 5.  This method of loading/unloading DISM generation libraries supports ANYCPU, X86, and AMD64, and also supports the CLR "Prefer 32-bit" setting.
